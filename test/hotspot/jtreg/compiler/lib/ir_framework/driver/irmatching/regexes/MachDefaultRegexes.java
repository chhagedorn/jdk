/**
 * This class provides default regex strings for matches on all compile phases on the Mach graph after matching (i.e.
 * after the application of optimization on the ideal graph). These default regexes replace any usages of placeholder s
 * trings from {@link IRNode} in check attributes {@link IR#failOn()} and {@link IR#counts()} depending on the specified
 * compile phases in {@link IR#phase()} and if the compile phase is returned in the list {@link CompilePhase#getMachPhases()}.
 * <p>
 *
 * Each new default regex for any node that needs to be matched on the ideal graph should be defined here together with
 * a mapping for which compile phase it can be used (defined with an entry in {@link DefaultRegexes#PLACEHOLDER_TO_REGEX_MAP}).
 * A mach default regexes can never be matched on the PrintIdeal or PrintOptoAssembly flag output.
 * <p>
 *
 * Not all regexes can be applied for all phases. If such an unsupported mapping is used for a compile phase, a format
 * violation is reported.
 * <p>
 *
 * There are two types of default regexes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><p>Standalone regexes: Replace the placeholder string from {@link IRNode} directly.</li>
 *     <li><p>Composite regexes: The placeholder string from {@link IRNode} contain an additional "{@code P#}" prefix.
 *                               This placeholder strings expect another user provided string in the constraint list of
 *                               {@link IR#failOn()} and {@link IR#counts()}. They cannot be use as standalone regex.
 *                               Trying to do so will result in a format violation error.</li>
